# Multi-Robot Coordination

This work is described in the publication _"Multi-robot Coordination with Agent-Server Architecture for Autonomous Navigation in Partially Unknown Environments" by Luca Bartolomei, Marco Karrer and Margarita Chli, IROS 2020_.  
The video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlFbiuV-d10).  

**This repo is under active maintenance.**

## Project Overview
This repository contains all the instructions to install and run the multi-robot planning pipeline described in the paper above. In particular, the pipeline is composed of many different components that run either on the server or on the agents.  
On the server side, the main components are:
* Multi-robot Global Planner - this repository
* Pose Graph Backend - [link](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/pose_graph_backend)
* Multi-agent Voxblox - [link](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/voxblox_multi_agent)  

Onboard each agent, the main components are:
* Client-server version of VINS-Mono - [link](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/vins_client_server)
* Local Obstacle avoidance -  this repository

The experiences collected by all the agents are sent to the central server, where an optimization-based pose-graph backend fuses all of them. The backend generates a globally consistent map of the navigation environment and localizes the agents in it. This map is used by the global planner, that coordinates the motions of the robots navigating them towards the respective goal positions.

## Gazebo Powerplant experiment
In this experiment, three robots have to cover a list of user-defined waypoints in the RotorS `Powerplant` Gazebo model. In this case, the state estimates are provided by Gazebo and the pose-graph back-end will not be utilized. This experiment is meant to test and showcase the global planner.  
First, start the simulation with:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation mav_sim_powerplant_three.launch
```  
Once the simulation is started, it is possible to start the global planner and the local planners for all the agents in separate terminals:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_global_planner mrp_global_planner_powerplant.launch
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_local_planner.launch agent_id:=0
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_local_planner.launch agent_id:=1
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_local_planner.launch agent_id:=2
```  
To start the experiments, call the service `rosservice call /multi_robot_global_planner/plan "{}"`. It is possible to change the waypoints for the agents in the file `multi_robot_global_planner/cfg/waypoints/waypoints_powerplant.yaml`.

## Chemical Plant Experiments
In this section we show how to run the experiments reported in the paper in a photo-realistic environment using Gazebo. The model that will be used is the abandoned Chemical Plant in RÃ¼dersdorf. A complete 3D model of the plant is available [here](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/abandoned-chemical-plant-rudersdorf-rawscan-d2464ec36fb644f28e904e5517f1da64) - all credits go to the original author.  
In order to import the model in Gazebo, follow these instructions, after having installed ROS and Gazebo and cloned this repository in a valid catkin workspace.
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/multi_robot_coordination
$ cp resources/chemical_plant.tar.xz ~/.gazebo/models  # Copy to Gazebo models folder
$ cd ~/.gazebo/models/
$ tar -xvf chemical_plant.tar.xz  # Unzip
$ rm chemical_plant.tar.xz  # Remove zip file
```  
To test if the model has been properly set, run:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation mav_sim_example.launch world:=chemical-plant run_gazebo_gui:=true
```
The model will take some time to load. When it is done, you should be able to see the model imported in Gazebo.

#### Note
Running the experiments with more than one agent is not recommended on a single PC, unless you have a particularly powerful PC (since it would be running visual-inertial odometry, pointcloud filtering, Pose Graph optimization, loop detection, mesh reconstruction and path planning for every agent).  
In general, it is recommended to outsource some of the computations to external PCs. In particular, we recommend to run on a central server:
* Pose-graph backend;
* Voxblox mapping;
* Global path planning; and 
* Gazebo. 

Instead, on the single agents, run:
* Visual-Inertial state estimation (VINS-Mono);
* Local mapping;
* Local path planning; and
* MPC controller.

#### Run the simulation on multiple PCs
Here we show how to run the Gazebo simulation on two PCs. Make sure that the two computers are connected to the same network (Wi-Fi or via cable - cable recommended). First, install:
```
$ sudo apt install net-tools
```  
On the PC where you are going to run the Gazebo simulation, start a `roscore`. Then, **in all the terminals you are going to use**, export the `ROS_IP` and set the `ROS Master URI`:  
```
$ ifconfig  # to get the IP of the first machine -> here ${machine_1_ip}
$ export ROS_IP=${machine_1_ip}  
$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://${machine_1_ip}:11311/
```  
Then you can start the simulation on the master PC (in this example, for four agents):  
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation mav_sim_chemical_plant_four.launch 
```
In the second PC, in **all the terminals** you are going to use, make sure you **export ROS_IP of the second machine** and the **ROS Master URI of the first machine**:
```
$ ifconfig # to get the IP of the second machine -> here ${machine_2_ip}
$ export ROS_IP=${machine_2_ip}  
$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://${machine_1_ip}:11311/  # Note: machine 1 here!
``` 
It is now possible to run other nodes on the two PCs - all the nodes will be connected to the same `rosmaster`.

### 1. Map navigation with 4 agents
In this experiment, we show how to run the complete pipeline in order to perform a full exploration of an area of interest, selected at the beginning of the mission by the user. If multiple PCs are in use, make sure to run the right launch file on the right computer.  
First, start the simulation:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation mav_sim_chemical_plant_four.launch
```
Once the simulation is started (i.e. wait for all the agents to be visible in RViz), it is possible to launch VINS-Mono and the mapping pipeline for every agent. These nodes should run onboard each agent's PC. For the first agent:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation vins_sim.launch agent_id:=0
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_mapping_sim.launch agent_mapping_four_sim_0.launch
```
Repeat the same operation for all the agents, launching the nodes in the respective PCs:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation vins_sim.launch agent_id:=1
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_mapping_sim.launch agent_mapping_four_sim_1.launch

$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation vins_sim.launch agent_id:=2
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_mapping_sim.launch agent_mapping_four_sim_2.launch

$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation vins_sim.launch agent_id:=3
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_mapping_sim.launch agent_mapping_four_sim_3.launch
```  
On the server's side, start the pose graph and wait for the initialization to be done:
```
$ roslaunch pose_graph_backend pose_graph_node_simulation.launch num_agents:=4
```
It is possible now to launch the path-planning pipeline. On the server's PC:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_global_planner mrp_global_planner_chemical_plant_four.launch
```
On the agents' PCs, run on the respective PCs:
```
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_local_planner_sim.launch agent_id:=0
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation gps_pose_graph_initializer.launch agent_id:=0

$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_local_planner_sim.launch agent_id:=1
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation gps_pose_graph_initializer.launch agent_id:=1

$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_local_planner_sim.launch agent_id:=2
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation gps_pose_graph_initializer.launch agent_id:=2

$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_local_planner_sim.launch agent_id:=3
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation gps_pose_graph_initializer.launch agent_id:=3
```
Once everything is properly set up, it is possible to run the experiment. First, initialize MSF for all the agents:
```
$ rosservice call /firefly_0/pose_sensor_vins_0/pose_sensor/initialize_msf_scale "scale: 1.0"
$ rosservice call /firefly_1/pose_sensor_vins_1/pose_sensor/initialize_msf_scale "scale: 1.0"
$ rosservice call /firefly_2/pose_sensor_vins_2/pose_sensor/initialize_msf_scale "scale: 1.0"
$ rosservice call /firefly_3/pose_sensor_vins_3/pose_sensor/initialize_msf_scale "scale: 1.0"
```
Then, start the planning:
```
$ rosservice call /multi_robot_global_planner/plan "{}"
```  
It is possible to trigger the `Return-Home` behaviour by publishing on the topic:
```
$ rostopic pub /multi_robot_global_planner/return_home std_msgs/Int16 "data: 0" -1
```
where you need to put the right agent ID in the `data` field. If you put `-1`, all the agents will return home.

### 2. Map re-use between agents
In this experiment, we showcase the advantages of the centralized path-planning pipeline, by showing how an agent can re-use the map created by another robot. Notice that, due to the stochasticity of the RRT* planner, it may happen that in some runs one of the agents may not go through the same area mapped by the other UAVs.  
First, start the simulation:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation mav_sim_chemical_plant_exp_common_map.launch
```
Once the simulation is started (i.e. wait for all the agents to be visible in RViz), it is possible to launch VINS-Mono and the mapping pipeline for every agent. These nodes should run onboard each agent's PC. For the first agent:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation vins_sim.launch agent_id:=0
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_mapping_sim.launch agent_mapping_four_sim_0.launch
```
Repeat the same operation for the other agent:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation vins_sim.launch agent_id:=1
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_mapping_sim.launch agent_mapping_four_sim_1.launch
```  
On the server's side, start the pose graph and wait for the initialization to be done:
```
$ roslaunch pose_graph_backend pose_graph_node_simulation.launch num_agents:=2
```
It is possible now to launch the path-planning pipeline. On the server's PC:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_global_planner mrp_global_planner_chemical_plant_exp_common_map.launch
```
On the agents' PCs, run on the respective PCs:
```
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_local_planner_sim.launch agent_id:=0
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation gps_pose_graph_initializer.launch agent_id:=0

$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_local_planner_sim.launch agent_id:=1
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation gps_pose_graph_initializer.launch agent_id:=1
```
Once everything is properly set up, it is possible to run the experiment. First, initialize MSF for all the agents:
```
$ rosservice call /firefly_0/pose_sensor_vins_0/pose_sensor/initialize_msf_scale "scale: 1.0"
$ rosservice call /firefly_1/pose_sensor_vins_1/pose_sensor/initialize_msf_scale "scale: 1.0"
```
Then, start the planning:
```
$ rosservice call /multi_robot_global_planner/plan "{}"
```  
It is possible to trigger the `Return-Home` behaviour by publishing on the topic:
```
$ rostopic pub /multi_robot_global_planner/return_home std_msgs/Int16 "data: 0" -1
```
where you need to put the right agent ID in the `data` field. If you put `-1`, all the agents will return home.

## 3. Planning in same area of interest
In the last experiment, we show the performace of the global planner when three agents have to navigate in the same area of interest.
First, start the simulation:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation mav_sim_chemical_plant_three_twist.launch
```
Once the simulation is started (i.e. wait for all the agents to be visible in RViz), it is possible to launch VINS-Mono and the mapping pipeline for every agent. These nodes should run onboard each agent's PC. For the first agent:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation vins_sim.launch agent_id:=0
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_mapping_sim.launch agent_mapping_four_sim_0.launch
```
Repeat the same operation for all the agents, launching the nodes in the respective PCs:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation vins_sim.launch agent_id:=1
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_mapping_sim.launch agent_mapping_four_sim_1.launch

$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation vins_sim.launch agent_id:=2
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_mapping_sim.launch agent_mapping_four_sim_2.launch
```  
On the server's side, start the pose graph and wait for the initialization to be done:
```
$ roslaunch pose_graph_backend pose_graph_node_simulation.launch num_agents:=3
```
It is possible now to launch the path-planning pipeline. On the server's PC:
```
$ roslaunch multi_robot_global_planner mrp_global_planner_chemical_plant_three_twist.launch
```
On the agents' PCs, run on the respective PCs:
```
$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_local_planner_sim.launch agent_id:=0
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation gps_pose_graph_initializer.launch agent_id:=0

$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_local_planner_sim.launch agent_id:=1
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation gps_pose_graph_initializer.launch agent_id:=1

$ roslaunch agent_local_planner agent_local_planner_sim.launch agent_id:=2
$ roslaunch multi_robot_simulation gps_pose_graph_initializer.launch agent_id:=2
```
Once everything is properly set up, it is possible to run the experiment. First, initialize MSF for all the agents:
```
$ rosservice call /firefly_0/pose_sensor_vins_0/pose_sensor/initialize_msf_scale "scale: 1.0"
$ rosservice call /firefly_1/pose_sensor_vins_1/pose_sensor/initialize_msf_scale "scale: 1.0"
$ rosservice call /firefly_2/pose_sensor_vins_2/pose_sensor/initialize_msf_scale "scale: 1.0"
```
Then, start the planning:
```
$ rosservice call /multi_robot_global_planner/plan "{}"
```  
It is possible to trigger the `Return-Home` behaviour by publishing on the topic:
```
$ rostopic pub /multi_robot_global_planner/return_home std_msgs/Int16 "data: 0" -1
```
where you need to put the right agent ID in the `data` field. If you put `-1`, all the agents will return home.

## Troubleshooting
